# Defensive NodeJS Modernization

## Overview
This project focuses on modernizing a legacy Node.js Express server by addressing critical security vulnerabilities, enhancing infrastructure resilience, and improving overall scalability.

## Key Features
- **Legacy Code Modernization**: Refactoring outdated and unmaintained code for improved maintainability.
- **Security Enhancements**: Replaced `eval` usage, mitigated filesystem vulnerabilities, and improved input validation.
- **Infrastructure Improvements**: Enhanced stability with `execFile` for safer child processes and enforced strict mode compliance.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js / Express**
- **ESLint for Static Code Analysis**
- **safe-eval** for safer evaluation of code
- **Path & FS Modules**
